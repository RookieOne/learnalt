# Learning alt

I experimented with a few new libraries & techniques with this project.

### Running the app

```
gulp
```

That is it.


### Materialize.css

I tried out Materialize.css (http://materializecss.com/)

There were some wins and some losses. Not sold on it yet.

### alt

I tried out alt (https://github.com/goatslacker/alt) an implementation of flux.

I thoroughly enjoyed working with `alt`. Embracing the ES6 formatting and the structure made actions and stores clean, easy to read, and quick to grok how to get things done.

Super happy with this library.

### 6to5

It was also my first foray into going full ES6. I used 6to5 (https://6to5.org/) as my transpiler mixing it in with browserify.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed working with ES6 syntax. The examples from `alt` was the first real example of how much noise could be eliminated from standard JavaScript.

So part of that elimination of noise, I opted to not use semi-colons.
